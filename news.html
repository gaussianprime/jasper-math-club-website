	<h2>Competitions</h2>
	<p>Some members of math club have contacted me about making a Jasper team for HMMT November. 
	You can read more about what HMMT November will look like <a href = https://www.hmmt.co/> here </a>
	Basically, it's online, teams can be formed without restrictions, and no registration fee. </p>
	
	<p>I think it's a great opportunity if you're curious what math competitions outside of AMCs look like without commitments like travel/paying fees. 
	Please indicate your interest <a href = https://forms.gle/WMZra6LMJ7bxbGuf6> here. </a> </p>
